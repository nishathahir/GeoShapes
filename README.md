# GeoShapes
Geoshapes is a software package that describes all possible shapes of mathematics.
It displays all the shapes on click and their areas and perimeters/circumferences when we give the measurements in the specified boxes.
It is developed in c programming language. 
On clicking the name of a shape, the shape will be displayed, underneath there are the text boxes to accept measurements.
After giving the measurements, when we can click either area or perimeter butten, that will be displayed.
